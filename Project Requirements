Write an ARM disassembler capable of loading an executable on Raspberry pi and disassembling it.
It must be clean and modular so that pieces may be removed and given to students to write and replace.
It must not be publicly visible so you don't give the answers away. (Private Repo)

It must disassemble all the instructions covered in cpe390, but does not have to disassemble every instruction on an ARM.
Try to break it up as cleanly as possible. 
One big switch statement, calling functions, each of which handles a particular class of instruction. Perhaps subdivisions of those if needed.

Handle all modes for ldr and str.

ldr  r0, [r1]
ldr  r0, [r1, #4]
ldr  r0, [r1], #4
ldr  r0, [r1, #4]!
etc.

A program to test all the instructions will be given.
Must be completed by or around December 10th (Not sure about final exam times at the moment).
The requirement of this project, independent of its functionality, is steady work by each person showing.
